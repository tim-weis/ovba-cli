# ovba

Command line utility to inspect and extract Office VBA projects from [Office Open XML](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm) documents.

## Usage

The *ovba* tool reads from files or standard input (`stdin`), and writes to files or standard output (`stdout`). Errors are reported to standard error (`stderr`) so as to not interfere with output `stdout`.

The following subcommands are available:

* `dump`
